# Dream

Dream is a cross-platform,API-agnostic and low level graphics layer. It aims to force developers to work on low level interfaces without making them lost in the boiler plate implementation specific code. However Dream does not rip off all the implementation specific code from your hands. It also exposes few interfaces to interact with API specific options upon creating objects.
